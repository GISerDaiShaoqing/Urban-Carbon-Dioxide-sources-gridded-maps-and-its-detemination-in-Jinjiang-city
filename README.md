## Introduction

The open dataset published in the [Data in Brief](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.105274) and used to produce a recent publication in [Journal of Cleaner Production](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.118659). You can download the data and use. Please contact me if you have question!

## Open dataset
We built a spatial database Carbon Dioxide emissions and urban form fragmentation for the low carbon urban system in Jinjiang city, China. Detailed information can see in this [url](http://science.gisersqdai.top/DIB/DIBdata.html).
